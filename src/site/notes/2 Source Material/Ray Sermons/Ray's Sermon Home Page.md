# Introduction to Ray's Sermon Index

by: Craig

I've been doing some light research on the system Ray used to organize his sermons. Ray and I had countless conversations about his process and how he approached preparation and planning for preaching God's Word.

After his passing, I wanted to ensure his system was protected and didn't end up forgotten in a box. It's hard to capture the depth and breadth of work represented in his collection. From what I can tell, he never missed a week. From his first sermon entry on [[2 Source Material/Ray Sermons/Index/001 Index\|page 1]] dated June 14, 1957, in Milan, Michigan, to his final entry on [[2 Source Material/Ray Sermons/Index/276 Index\|page 276]] on December 5, 2021, in Peoria, Arizona, he preached 6535 sermons over 64 years, 5 months, and 21 days.

> Ray produced 101 sermons a year for 64 years.

That's about 1.94 sermons per week. This number includes gospel meetings, morning and evening sermons, and all his time off (though he was never keen on missing Sundays). He was truly prolific in his work for the Lord.

As a family, we plan to carefully disperse his collection of sermon cards among our households. These cards have meaningful topics, special occasions, and treasures yet to be discovered. Holly and I have started the process and plan to digitize the 276-page index for searching and for all of us to have access to study his outlines.  We'll scan some sermon cards, although scanning them all is simply too large a task.  The digital index will have all of his sermon titles and we can exchenge cards as we like.  

My first step was to find more about this organizational system. After a few web searches, I discovered there wasn't much information available. Recently, I asked a AI tool to do some deeper research. It conducted an exhaustive search across the internet, old newspapers, and church bulletin archives.  Below is the report...enjoy.

Thanks Ray...

## The Filco Bible Index System
### History

The Filco Sermon Index Service was part of a suite of mid-20th-century ministerial tools developed in Washington, D.C., under the auspices of **The Mount Vernon Foundation**. The foundation introduced these “Modern Tools for Ministers” in the early 1950s, with the **Filco Memory-O-Matic System** launching around 1951–1952 and the **Filco Sermon Index Service** following by 1956. The content was compiled by **Robert H. Kells**, who is credited as the compiler of the Filco volumes. The Mount Vernon Foundation (based in Washington, likely taking its name from the Mount Vernon area) published and distributed the Filco products, which were released as ring-bound volumes for ease of updating.

The Filco services were sold widely to preachers, pastoral students, and churches across denominations. Marketing appears to have been done through direct sales representatives and advertisements in religious periodicals. Regional _divisional directors_ of the Mount Vernon Foundation demonstrated and sold the system to ministers (one 1958 account from Baylor University describes a representative showcasing these “modern tools for ministers” to students and clergy). Promotional notices and ads for the Filco filing system appeared in church publications of the day – for example, references to the Mount Vernon Foundation’s sermon indexing and filing system were noted in _Gospel Messenger_ (Jan. 1959) and the _Christian Leader_ (Nov. 1, 1957). These channels helped introduce the Filco system to thousands of ministers during the 1950s. The price was relatively steep: a contemporary seller noted paying “nearly $80” (a substantial sum in the 1950s) for the complete Memory-O-Matic set. This indicates the Filco system was a significant investment, often justified as a professional tool for organizing a pastor’s life’s work.

## System Description

The Filco Sermon Index Service was essentially a **topical indexing and filing system** to help ministers catalog their sermon materials, illustrations, and research notes for quick retrieval. It did not consist of actual pre-written sermons, but rather an organizational framework (binders, index cards or sheets, subject headings, and cross-references) that a pastor could use to file and find content. The core of the system was typically a **large ring-binder** filled with pre-printed index dividers and forms. Each divider was labeled with a topic or category relevant to sermon construction (for example, topics like _Courage_, _Leadership_, _Forgiveness_, etc.), and often the divider pages themselves included illustrative anecdotes or quotes to inspire the preacher. The Sermon Index Service component likely focused on indexing sermon ideas by biblical text and subject, whereas the related **Filco Memory-O-Matic** was used for general research notes and the **Filco Reference Library** for filing sermon illustrations (clippings, stories, quotes). Later expansions included the **Filco Counseling and Guidance Services**, suggesting additional sections for pastoral counseling topics. All of these fell under the “Modern Tools for Ministers” umbrella.

Ministers using the system would write out or file their notes on standardized cards or sheets and then file them behind the appropriate topical tabs. Over time this built a personalized “catalog” of their sermon content. _Dr. Martin Luther King Jr._, for instance, during his seminary years (circa 1949–1951) used the Filco Memory-O-Matic and Reference Library system to organize his class notes and sermon ideas. The archive of his papers shows blank and annotated Filco forms, indicating how the system worked: King would jot down sermon illustrations or bibliographic references on the forms, then file them by topic for later use. Another user recalled that the Filco kit came with an extensive classification scheme and even included supplementary resources – one buyer noted his set came with a **“Mem-O-Matic” supplement and an extensive film literature service** (possibly microfilm or printed excerpts), implying that the system provided not just an empty framework but also curated content or updates over time.

In practical terms, the Filco Sermon Index made a minister’s library into a searchable database (on paper). A Church of Christ congregation history describes how their minister catalogued all library materials with the Filco system, making them “much more accessible to everyone” ([Cedar Grove church of Christ | History](https://www.thelordsway.com/site16/history.asp?CongregationID=950#:~:text=the%20addition%20of%20150%20new,must%20more%20accessible%20to%20everyone)). By systematically filing sermon outlines, illustrations, scriptures, and cross-references, a preacher could quickly retrieve material when writing a new sermon or lesson. This was a novel solution in an era before computer databases – effectively a manual search engine for one’s own theological resources. The system’s design was influenced by library science and business filing techniques, adapted specifically for clergy needs. Each topic was given a code or section, and new material could be continually added; the ring-binder format allowed adding or re-arranging pages as the user’s collection grew. Many found that this organized approach saved time in sermon preparation, as illustrated by one description: _“All materials were catalogued by the Filco system, which made them much more accessible”_ for study and teaching ([Cedar Grove church of Christ | History](https://www.thelordsway.com/site16/history.asp?CongregationID=950#:~:text=the%20addition%20of%20150%20new,must%20more%20accessible%20to%20everyone)). In short, the Filco Sermon Index Service functioned as a personalized index of sermon ideas and resources, tailored to the way preachers think and work.

## Notable Users and Impact

The Filco indexing systems gained a substantial user base among mid-century preachers, seminary students, and religious leaders. Perhaps the most famous user was **Martin Luther King Jr.**, who as a young seminarian at Crozer Theological Seminary utilized Filco’s Memory-O-Matic and Reference Library services for his coursework and early sermons.  King’s preserved notes show he adopted this “filing system for illustrations” to organize sermon topics and references, which no doubt contributed to the depth and preparedness evident in his later preaching. Another prominent adopter was **Frank H. Epp**, a Canadian Mennonite minister and scholar, who in the late 1950s employed the Mount Vernon Foundation’s filing system for his research and sermon illustration files. Epp’s archival papers even retain some Filco materials (such as the printed topic heading sheets), demonstrating how he and others integrated Filco’s scheme into their own workflow.

Beyond individual high-profile users, the Filco system was influential enough to be taught and recommended in ministerial training. At the Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, the faculty offered a **“voluntary class for keeping records called Memory-O-Matic”** during the 1950s ([Eli Harju, BBFI Educator - Tribune.org](https://www.tribune.org/eli-harju-bbfi-educator/#:~:text=Missouri,1970)). This indicates that formal training programs saw value in instructing future pastors on how to use the Filco method to manage their sermon content. Many Bible college and seminary students invested in the system early in their careers. Denominational circles across the spectrum – from Baptist to Church of Christ to Adventist – encountered Filco. For example, an Adventist pastor in California purchased the Memory-O-Matic in the 1950s (via a sales rep or mail order) but ended up selling it unused, which gives a hint that the product reached even those in smaller or remote ministries.

Users often praised the concept: instead of relying on memory or scattered notebooks, they could build a **personal sermon index** over years. Testimonials in periodicals spoke of the Filco system as a boon to busy preachers who needed to “file away today’s inspiration for tomorrow’s sermon.” Churches sometimes set up their libraries or pastor’s study around the system; for instance, in the 1970s, the Cedar Grove Church of Christ (Alabama) expanded their library and used the Filco cataloging system to organize all books and audiovisuals for the minister’s use. This longevity suggests that those who adopted Filco’s method often continued with it for decades, finding it sufficiently useful even as other tools emerged. By centralizing sermon outlines, illustrations, and study notes, the Filco Service left a mark on how a generation of ministers managed information – it brought a new level of rigor and efficiency to evangelical research in the pre-digital age.

## Surviving Materials and Legacy

Today, the Filco Sermon Index Service and its companion tools are largely out of print and survive mainly in archives and private collections. Original Filco binders or kits occasionally surface in library catalogs or second-hand listings, identified by their **“Modern Tools for Ministers”** subtitle and distinctive ring-bound format from the 1950s. For example, an Amazon marketplace listing (now unavailable) showed _Filco Sermon Index Service, published 1956 by The Mount Vernon Foundation_ in a ring-binder, confirming the basic publication details. Some libraries may hold the volumes (often cataloged under Kells’ name or the Foundation). Additionally, pieces of the system have been preserved in personal papers of clergymen: the **Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection** retains about 19 pages of Filco Memory-O-Matic forms annotated by King ([Filco Memory-O-Matic: Religion 88, circa 1949-1951 | Archives Research Center](https://findingaids.auctr.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/177362#:~:text=other%20items%20presumably%20used%20in,religious%20book%20club%20order%20forms)), and the **Mennonite Archives of Ontario** hold Filco topic sheets from Frank Epp’s files (for instance, a printed “Courage” heading sheet with its illustrative story) ([Mennonite Archives of Ontario | University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/mennonite-archives-ontario/catalogs/archives/epp-frank-h-86-professions-87-psychology#:~:text=pamphlet,25f)). Such archival remnants give us a direct glimpse of how the system looked and was used.

Documentation about Filco can also be found in periodicals of that era. As noted, magazines like _Gospel Messenger_and _Christian Leader_ carried notices or ads for the Filco services. While the full texts of those ads are not reproduced here, their existence in 1957–1961 issues suggests that the company provided descriptive brochures and catalogs to interested ministers. It’s likely that an official **user’s manual** or pamphlet accompanied each Filco set, explaining how to classify topics, cross-reference scriptures, and keep the index up to date – though these manuals are now rare. Some might be tucked inside surviving binders or archived in seminaries that used them. The Filco systems themselves, being loose-leaf, lent themselves to customization; thus, surviving examples might vary as owners added their own content.

In terms of legacy, the Filco Sermon Index Service was a forerunner to later computer-based sermon databases and illustration libraries. It addressed a timeless need for clergy: to recall and reuse vast amounts of study material efficiently. By all accounts, it succeeded in that mission for a time. Even though the Mount Vernon Foundation and its Filco products eventually faded (likely by the 1970s as information management moved to new mediums), the concept lives on in the way pastors organize their sermons today. Modern sermon software and online sermon-index websites are, in essence, the digital heirs of the Filco Memory-O-Matic. The physical binders may be collectibles now, but in the 1950s they were cutting-edge organizational tools. As one historian of preaching observed, the post-WWII era saw pastors adopting “business-like” methods to manage their ministries, and the Filco Sermon Index Service stands as a fascinating historical example of that trend – a well-engineered system that brought order to the creative chaos of sermon preparation.
