The first phase of the project is scanning the index.  Holly is using her phone to capture each page.  Craig runs the image through a optical character recognition process that pulls out the sermon names and bible references.  Chat GPT scans and assigns keywords to the index page for future organization.  Below you can see the recently scanned pages.
