Our process of scanning is quite simple:
1. Holly uses her phone to capture each page with Genius Scan App in iPhone.
2. This is saved to a folder on Craig's laptop.
3. The Obsidian app is used to build the web architecture.
4. The image of the scan is screened by a Chat GPT Project that has been training to pull sermon titles and scripture.
5. AI then tags the image for even more organization structure.
6. These images are copied to Git-Hub repository and pushed to a web server called Netlify.
7. The RayMillerSermons.com domain name is help by GoDaddy and forwarded to the collection.
8. That's it.  :)
