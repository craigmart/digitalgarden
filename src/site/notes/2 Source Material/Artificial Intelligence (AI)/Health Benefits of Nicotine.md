### 2. It’s Not the Nicotine That’s Dangerous—It’s the Smoke
- Most harm from cigarettes comes from **tar, chemicals, and combustion**, not nicotine itself.
- Nicotine on its own is **less addictive** and **much less harmful**.

### 3. NRT Is Often Used for More Than Quitting
A large study across 4 countries found:
- ~33% of smokers used NRT (patches, gum, etc.).
- ~33% of those used it for **non-standard reasons** like:
  - Cutting down on smoking.
  - Temporarily abstaining (e.g. on planes or at work).
