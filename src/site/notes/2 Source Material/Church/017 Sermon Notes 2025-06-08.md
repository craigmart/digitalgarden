- Acknowledgment of church volunteers:
  - **Nashville & Knoxville Work Camps**
  - **VBS preparations**
  - Gratitude for those pouring into student ministry

## II. Ministry Spotlight: Hands and Feet
- New bulletin board ministry near the office

- Second board: **mission opportunities**
- Get involved by filling out a card and handing it to someone in William’s class
- Focus: Serve our own church body first, then expand outward
- Emphasis: Be **transparent and bold** enough to ask for help

## III. Recap from Last Week
- Reference: [[2 Source Material/Church/016 Sermon Notes June 1, 2025\|016 Sermon Notes June 1, 2025]]
- The **Psalms** show a full range of emotions and model **honest prayer**
- The **Lord’s Prayer** reflects the essence of the Psalms
- Analogy: Law and Prophets → "Love God, love others" → Psalms unpack the heart of prayer

## IV. Prayer as a Way of Life
- [1 Thessalonians 5:16–18](http://Ref.ly/1th5.16)  
- [Philippians 4:5–6](http://Ref.ly/Phil4.5)
- Not a formula, but a **posture**  
- “Pray without ceasing” means **ongoing relationship**, not endless words  
- “In everything…” means nothing is too small to bring to God  
- God invites us to pray in all circumstances, even if we wonder, *Does this matter enough?*

## V. Biblical Examples of Prayer in Every Place

## VI. Without Prayer, We Wither
- “You might as well pull a fish out of water”
- Without prayer:
  - Like removing sun from a planet
  - Like removing oxygen from lungs
- **Prayer is who we are** as followers of Christ
- If you find a healthy Christian, you will find a healthy prayer life

## VII. In Him We Have Our Being
- [Acts 17:28](http://Ref.ly/Ac17.28) – *“In Him we live and move and have our being.”*
- You can’t live *in Him* without **a living prayer life**
- This is how we **abide** (cf. John 15)
- Prayer becomes an **eternal dialogue**: “God, that was amazing.” “God, I need You.”

## VIII. Psalm 4 – A Prayer About Prayer
- [Psalm 4](http://Ref.ly/PS4)
- **“Answer me when I call…”** – Expecting a response
- **“You gave me relief…”** – Remembrance builds trust
- **“Be angry and do not sin…”** – Process emotion, but **trust in the Lord**
- **“You’ve put more joy in my heart…”** – Deeper joy than worldly abundance
- **“I will lie down and sleep…”** – Peace comes from knowing **God dwells with us**

## IX. Final Reflection
- Whether you're hungry, sad, angry, joyful, or scared:
  - **The answer is always: Pray**
- In every emotion, every situation, and every season:
  - Bring it to the Father
