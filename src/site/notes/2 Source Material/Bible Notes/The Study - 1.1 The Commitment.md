**Source:** Excerpts from "[RVL Discipleship: The Study - 1.1 The Commitment](https://youtu.be/lyswXY7dzic?si=Tf3U7cQ_zCCj7-Z4)"

> **Subject:** Analysis of Core Concepts in RVL Discipleship - 1.1 The Commitment
> 
> **Purpose:** This document provides a review of the main themes and important ideas presented in the provided excerpts, focusing on the nature of discipleship and the significance of the Shema.
> 
> **Key Themes:**
> 
> - **Discipleship as a Life of Passionate Action:** The source emphasizes that discipleship is not merely a religious activity or intellectual understanding of God's path, but a passionate commitment to walk that path in all aspects of everyday life. It is contrasted with a purely religious or church-based understanding of discipleship.
> - **The [[Shema\|Shema]] as a Foundation for Discipleship:** The Shema, the Jewish [[4 Tags/Prayer List\|Prayer List]] beginning "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord alone," is presented as a central and foundational element of discipleship. It is described as "two sides of one coin" with discipleship, highlighting its role in focusing one's entire being on God.
> - **The Shema as a Loyalty Oath:** Beyond a statement of belief, the Shema, particularly the phrase "the Lord alone," is interpreted as a loyalty oath. In the context of ancient polytheistic societies, this emphasized exclusive devotion to the God of Moses and demanded a decision of commitment.
> - **Comprehensive Commitment:** The breakdown of the Shema's components ("heart," "soul," "might") highlights the expectation of a comprehensive and all-encompassing commitment to God. This includes one's intellect, emotions, physical abilities, resources, and daily activities. Discipleship is not a part-time endeavor.
> - **Discipleship in Everyday Life:** The source stresses that discipleship is to be lived out in all roles and professions, not just traditionally religious ones. Being a disciple means using one's abilities and talents, whether as a nurse or teacher, in a way that reflects this commitment to God.
> - **Intellectual Knowledge vs. Lived Commitment:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote highlighting the difference between intellectual understanding of scripture and a lived commitment to the principles of the Shema. This underscores the need for discipleship to move beyond mere knowledge to passionate action.
> 
> **Most Important Ideas/Facts:**
> 
> - **Redefining Discipleship:** Discipleship is not confined to religious activities but is a "path...chosen to walk...passionately...in everyday life."
> - **The Shema's Deeper Meaning:** The Hebrew word "Shema" means more than just "hear"; it primarily means "obey" or "do it."
> - **"Achad" as "Alone":** In the context of the Shema, "achad" (one) is emphasized as meaning "alone" or "only," signifying exclusive loyalty to God.
> - **The Shema's Comprehensive Call:** Loving God with "heart, soul, and might" encompasses intellect, emotions, and every resource and ability one possesses. This includes "every dime you have including that car that's parked in the parking lot."
> - **The Shema as a Loyalty Test:** The question "Is God really got a loan for you or do you find there are other voices that we tend to be drawn to in addition or maybe instead of" highlights the Shema as a test of allegiance.
> - **Discipleship Requires "All In":** The call to discipleship is a call to be "all in," to "give every ouch you've got," and to "leave nothing on the field."
> - **Discipleship is a Lived Experience:** The speaker's personal story illustrates the need to move from "intellectual knowledge" to a commitment that is "kicked up several notches" and lived "every moment of every day."
>
