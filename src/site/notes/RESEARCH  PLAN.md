**Project Title:**
**_Asymmetry of Postural Findings as a Clinical Marker of Locus Coeruleus Dysregulation in Veterans with PTSD_**  


**Background & Rationale:**
Recent neuropathological evidence from post-mortem studies of WWII veterans with PTSD suggests asymmetric enlargement of the [[2 Source Material/Review of Locus Coerulus\|locus coerulus]] (LC), a brainstem nucleus associated with arousal, attention, and sympathetic regulation. The LC has been implicated in PTSD pathophysiology due to its role in stress response and norepinephrine release. Given the LC’s connection to vestibular, postural, and autonomic systems, we hypothesize that subtle clinical markers — particularly asymmetrical postural findings — may serve as a non-invasive proxy for LC dysregulation in living veterans.


**Objective:**
To evaluate whether veterans with PTSD demonstrate consistent patterns of postural asymmetry, and whether chiropractic assessment can detect reproducible CNS-related findings that correlate with known CNS imbalance.


**Design & Methods:**
This exploratory observational study will use standard chiropractic and functional neurology exam protocols (e.g., postural analysis, eye movement assessment, gait pattern, and paraspinal tone) to document asymmetries in veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Data will be collected during routine clinical visits using a standardized rubric. Outcomes of interest include side-dominance of asymmetry, relationship to subjective symptoms, and changes over time with conservative care.


**Hypothesis:**
Veterans with PTSD will demonstrate consistent postural asymmetries corresponding to brainstem hemispheric dominance, potentially reflecting LC imbalance.


**Innovation:**
This project introduces a novel clinical observation pathway that may allow chiropractors and other neuromusculoskeletal providers to use non-invasive physical signs to infer underlying brainstem dysfunction. If validated, this could improve early screening, tracking of care response, and interdisciplinary communication in PTSD care.


**Anticipated Next Steps:**
Pending initial observational data, the investigators aim to formalize this protocol for IRB approval and pursue deeper neurological correlations through collaboration with imaging, psychiatry, and neuropsychology teams.
